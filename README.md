OpenXCodeDocumentInEmacs.sh
===========

OpenXCodeDocumentInEmacs.sh is simple shell script that will open the current Xcode editor document in Emacs. This shell script can be used as an Xcode behavior with a shortcut to quickly jump from Xcode to Emacs for editing, and makes using Emacs with Xcode projects a bit easier.

This works best when bound to the same key as https://github.com/iamdavidhart/EmacsOpenInXcode
